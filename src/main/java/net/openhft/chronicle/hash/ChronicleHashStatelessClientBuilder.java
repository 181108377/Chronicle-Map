/**
 * Builder of stateless {@link ChronicleHash} implementation, this stateless implementation will be
 * referred to as a stateless client as it
 * will not hold any of its own data locally, the stateless client will perform Remote Procedure
 * Calls ( RPC ) to another {@link ChronicleMap} or {@link ChronicleSet} which we will refer to
 * as the server. The server will hold all your data, the server can not itâ€™s self be a
 * stateless client. Your stateless client must be connected to the server via TCP/IP. The
 * stateless client will delegate all your method calls to the remote sever. The stateless
 * client operations will block, in other words the stateless client will wait for the server to
 * send a response before continuing to the next operation. The stateless client could be
 * consider to be a ClientProxy to  {@link ChronicleMap} or {@link ChronicleSet}  running on
 * another host
 *
 * @param <H> the type of {@code ChronicleHash} accessed remotely, {@code ChronicleMap} or
